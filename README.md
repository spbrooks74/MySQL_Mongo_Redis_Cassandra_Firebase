# MySQL_Mongo_Redis_Cassandra_Firebase

Part1:  Modify an existing relational database using a Docker container. 

Part2:  Update data in a MongoDB that is running inside a Docker container. (installed the MongoDB libraries for Python by running pip3 install pymongo and that MongoDB is running in my Docker container in port 27017) 

Part3:  Created a simple key-value database using Redis. 

Part4:  Deployed a Cassandra database to a Docker container.  First, read and write data from the database using a Python program client. Then, ran queries using the cqlsh Terminal command line.
